The Jazz Chorus probably the most recognizable Roland amp ever created. Also probably the most highly sought after solid state amp on the planet. And maybe the most highly used clean tone that has ever been created!

Simply one of the best clean tone in the world. Many artist have used the Roland JC amps for their recorded clean tone and their live tone as well. The 160 is much like the 120 with a different set of speakers and a larger cabinet. You get the same features and tone but you have four 10 inch speaker instead of two 12 inch and the wattage is bumped up to 160 instead of 120.
