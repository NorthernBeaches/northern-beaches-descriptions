Includes 1 litre of fluid and remote.

Antari's Z-800 MK2 might be small, but it delivers a grand performance. This small yet powerful smoke machine can be used for many different situations. It's controlled via the included remote control, has a very short warming-up time, and produces a constant fog as long as you need. New technology even results in 20 % less power consumption.
