The Zoom R16 instantly transforms any environment into a recording studio. Not only does it offer 16 tracks for recording, it can also be used as a DAW control surface and audio interface, allowing you to craft great-sounding music both at home and wherever your travels take you. The R16 has it all: built-in stereo condenser microphones, 8 mic/line/instrument inputs for connecting external gear, a whopping 135 onboard DSP effects—even a chromatic tuner.

The R16 provides sixteen tracks for recording and playback (up to eight tracks can be recorded simultaneously) in full fidelity WAV format, making it ideal for both professional production and for use as a musical sketchpad. Battery operation allows for field recording and enables you to capture your musical ideas quickly. You can connect external microphones or line-level sources directly to the R16, or use the built-in stereo mic pair for minimal setup. You can also plug instruments such as electric guitar or bass right into the R16. When your multitrack recording is complete, you can use the R16's internal mixer, complete with real faders, equalisation, panning, and 135 built-in DSP effects—including amp models and mastering effects like multi-band compression—to create a stereo mix with studio-quality sound.
