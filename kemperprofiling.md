The Kemper Profiling Amplifier enables you to do what generations of guitar players have been waiting for: to capture the soul of all your amps (and so many more) inside a lunchbox-sized amplifier.

With cutting edge technology Kemper captures the sonic DNA of virtually any guitar amp for vivid and dynamic sound.

They were created by professional guitarists, engineers and producers in studios all over the world. Right out of the box, you will find classic tones of studio standards as well as profiles of highly sought-after amplifiers, some costing many times the price of the Profiling Amplifier. If you are looking for a particular sound, search the Rig Exchange database on our website, and download profiles and rigs from fellow users. You can also make your own profiles from your gear.
