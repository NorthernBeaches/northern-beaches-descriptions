The all-valve, 4-channel JVM410H guitar combo amp is the most versatile Marshall amplifier ever made.

British-built, the 100 Watt 2 x 12" all-tube Marshlall JVM410C combo redefines versatility thanks to four tonally-independent channels: clean, crunch, OD1 and OD2, each with three switchable modes. Each mode reconfigures the gain structure of each channel, making twelve modes in total.

The Marshall JVM410C front panel looks mind boggling with its twenty eight controls and eight switches, but because it is intuitively laid out, it is remarkably simple to use. The JVM410H also features four studio-quality digital reverb controls (one per channel), individual channel EQ, two master volumes, and a footswitchable memory that can recall your reverb, FX loop and master settings.

Marshall's revolutionary Stompware foot switching technology gives you unprecedented control of you setup, with straight switching or programmable switching. The six-button footswitch connects to the amp using a standard guitar lead, so you’re not restricted by stage size – and if your cable fails, then it’s very easy to replace.

Combining some of the finest Marshall sounds, the JVM410C has a vast tonal palette, taking you from 'Plexi'/JTM45 cleans through JCM800 roar to modern high gain.

The MarshallJVM410C is loaded with a Vintage 30 speaker and a Heritage speaker, both of which have unique aural characteristics that make them a perfect match, giving you the best of both sonic worlds.
