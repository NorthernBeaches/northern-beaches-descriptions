The DDJ-SZ2 builds on the strong foundations of its predecessor, the flagship DDJ-SZ controller. This upgrade to the flagship Serato DJ controller allows you to get hands on with the latest additions to Serato DJ, including key shift, key sync, pitch play and Serato Flip. The jog wheel latency has been improved to make scratching more responsive and precise and the multi-coloured performance pads give you instant feedback on playing status and pad modes.
