The Behringer XENYX 1002 has 10 inputs and a FX Send control for each channel. Additionally, assignable CD/tape inputs have been incorporated for routing flexibility. The new XENYX Mic Preamp matches the sound quality, transparency, headroom and even the dynamic range of boutique-style, stand-alone mic preamps. Neo-classic British EQ brings back the warmth and musicality of those 60s and 70s mega-console desks that made music history.
