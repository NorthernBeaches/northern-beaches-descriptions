Same layout, size, and platter as the CDJ-2000NXS, but leave your CDs at home.

---

Pioneer’s XDJ-1000 Performance Multi Player ditches CDs and goes strictly digital. Adopting the same advanced layout, size, and ergonomic platter as the professional series CDJ-2000NXS, the XDJ-1000 offers a wealth of DJ performance functions and adds the convenience of touch screen, utilizing a large 7″ full-color high resolution touch panel display for access and control of multiple features. Users can quickly see and execute a variety of commands that were once only accessed through physical buttons. With the convenience of its large touch display, users are provided with faster control, more information, and the ability to toggle through different screens to make DJ performance easier. The XDJ-1000 features a large JOG wheel, PRO DJ Link, rekordbox compatibility, Wi-Fi connectivity, and more.
