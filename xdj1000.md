Same layout, size, and platter as the CDJ-2000NXS, but leave your CDs at home.

---

Pioneer’s XDJ-1000 Performance Multi Player ditches CDs and goes strictly digital. Adopting the same advanced layout, size, and ergonomic platter as the professional series CDJ-2000NXS, the XDJ-1000 offers a wealth of DJ performance functions and adds the convenience of touch screen, utilizing a large 7″ full-color high resolution touch panel display for access and control of multiple features. Users can quickly see and execute a variety of commands that were once only accessed through physical buttons. With the convenience of its large touch display, users are provided with faster control, more information, and the ability to toggle through different screens to make DJ performance easier. The XDJ-1000 features a large JOG wheel, PRO DJ Link, rekordbox compatibility, Wi-Fi connectivity, and more.

Large, full color touch screen with intuitive GUI
The 7-inch, full color LCD touch screen gives DJs instinctive control and enables the ultimate creativity. The GUI is divided into three sections: Browse, Play and Perform, so DJs can effortlessly see and access all the features they need, without the screen being over-crowded.

Faster browsing with Qwerty KEYBOARD and KEYWORD SEARCH
The Browse function is speedier than ever, with the ability to call up a Qwerty keyboard and search for keywords, and scroll using the touch screen or large rotary dial. Plus DJs can choose how they view tracks: list, artwork, or custom view.
