The BLX1 Bodypack Transmitter from Shure is designed for use with Shureâ€™s BLX wireless systems. 

It is set to the K12 frequency band and operates between 614 and 638 MHz.

It has a TQG input and can be used with Shure lavalier, headset, earset and instrument microphones.

With the optional WA302 adapter cable, the BLX1 can be used as a transmitter for guitar.

The unit has a top panel mounted on/off switch as well as volume control for quick access while speaking or performing. 

The BLX1 is powered by the two included AA batteries for up to 14 hours.

The Shure WH20 is a rugged, lightweight, dynamic headset microphone that provides high-quality voice pickup. 

It fits securely for active microphone users, such as aerobics instructors and musicians, with low visibility for stage appearances.

The cardioid (unidirectional) pickup pattern provides greater gain-before-feedback and isolation from ambient noise and other unwanted sound sources.

A carefully shaped frequency response includes a voice-frequency presence peak and a low-frequency roll-off to compensate for the proximity effect inherent in cardioid mics during close-talk operation.
